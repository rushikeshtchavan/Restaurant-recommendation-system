# Restaurant-recommendation-system

This project implements a Restaurant Recommendation System using data from Zomato. It combines data exploration, feature engineering, and various recommendation algorithms to suggest restaurants based on user preferences. The system leverages Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, and Hybrid Approaches to provide personalized recommendations.

With the explosion of online food services, personalized restaurant recommendations have become essential to improve user satisfaction and drive engagement. This project uses Zomato data to create a robust recommendation system that helps users discover new and relevant dining options.

# Features
Data Exploration and Analysis: Gain insights into restaurant attributes, user preferences, and trends.
Feature Engineering: Process raw data to extract meaningful features for recommendation models.
Recommendation Algorithms:
Collaborative Filtering
Content-Based Filtering
Hybrid Approaches
Evaluation Metrics: Assess the quality of recommendations using precision, recall, and Mean Average Precision (MAP).

# Libraries Used

NumPy (numpy): Efficient handling of numerical arrays and mathematical operations.  
Pandas (pandas): Data manipulation and analysis with DataFrame structures.  
Seaborn (seaborn): Advanced, aesthetic data visualization.    
Matplotlib (matplotlib.pyplot): Basic plotting for static and interactive visualizations.  
Scikit-learn (sklearn): Machine learning algorithms, data splitting, and evaluation metrics.  
Warnings (warnings): Suppresses unwanted warnings during execution.  
Regex (re): Pattern matching and text preprocessing with regular expressions.  
NLTK (nltk): Natural language processing, including stop word removal.  
Scikit-learn Similarity & Text Tools:  
linear_kernel: Computes cosine similarity for text vectors.  
CountVectorizer: Converts text into a sparse matrix of word counts.  
TfidfVectorizer: Transforms text into TF-IDF weighted features.  

# Dataset
The project uses the Zomato Restaurant Dataset, which contains information about restaurants, user reviews, ratings, and more. You can download the dataset from sources like Kaggle or other repositories.

**Key Attributes:**

Restaurant name, location, and cuisines
Average cost for two
User reviews and ratings
Tags such as "delivery," "dine-in," etc.

# Project Workflow

Data Exploration and Analysis : Explore trends in cuisine, location, ratings, and pricing.Visualize data distributions and correlations.  
  
Feature Engineering : Handle missing values and outliers.
Convert categorical variables into meaningful features (e.g., one-hot encoding). Create new features like cuisine similarity or popularity scores.  

Recommendation Algorithms : Implement and tune multiple recommendation strategies.  

Model Evaluation : Compare algorithms using metrics like precision, recall, and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

# Recommendation Algorithms
1. Collaborative Filtering
Description: Leverages user-item interactions (e.g., ratings) to recommend restaurants similar to those preferred by users.
Techniques:
Matrix Factorization (e.g., SVD, ALS)
User-based and Item-based Collaborative Filtering
2. Content-Based Filtering
Description: Recommends restaurants based on their features (e.g., cuisines, cost, location) matching a userâ€™s preferences.
Implementation:
Feature similarity using cosine similarity or Euclidean distance
3. Hybrid Approaches
Description: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering to leverage the strengths of both methods.
Implementation:
Weighted averaging or stacking of individual recommendations

# Results
Exploratory Analysis: Provided insights into popular cuisines, high-rated restaurants, and user preferences.
Recommendation Accuracy: Achieved precision and recall scores of X% and Y% respectively using the hybrid model.

# Future work   

Incorporate real-time user feedback to refine recommendations.  
Develop a user interface for an interactive recommendation system.  
Explore more advanced recommendation algorithms, such as deep learning models.  
Integrate location-based services for personalized recommendations.
